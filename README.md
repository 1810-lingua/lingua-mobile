# lingua-mobile

This is the mobile app of our language-learning platform, Lingua. The mobile app takes words that were added to Firebase through the Chrome extension, and creates flash cards from those words for the user to study. It also has an Image Detection feature that allows a user to take a picture of an object. The translation of the name of the object will pop up, along with the option to add it to the user's library of words to learn. After a word is marked as learned on the mobile side, the chrome extension will replace all instances of that word with its translation.
